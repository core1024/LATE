# LATE - Little Arduboy Timekiller Endeavour
A game that features several modes that fit into Arduboy memmory. I find them simple enough to code and pack together, so I'll be able to enjoy them on Arduboy too.

The game state is saved in the EEPROM when the pause menu is issued (usually by pressing [B]).

As of now, there's no support for RGB LED and sound.

Music is not planned at all.

## Tips and tricks:

Hold [Left] while pressing [A] in the menu for reset.
That way you can reset the current game state to start a new game (in the pause menu) or even reset the whole game data for the current mode (in the main menu), including high scores and any game state.

If you don't own Arduboy you can still build and play the game online [here](https://felipemanga.github.io/ProjectABE/?url=https://github.com/core1024/LATE) thaks to Project ABE.
